The code performs text similarity search by embedding documents and queries into vector representations using OpenAI embeddings.It then stores these embeddings in a FAISS index for fast similarity searching. The original documents are stored in a docstore to map the FAISS index results back to the corresponding documents. When a query is provided, it is embedded into a vector, and a similarity search is performed to retrieve the most relevant documents from the FAISS index based on their vector similarity. The results are then displayed to the user.

In short, this pipeline uses OpenAI embeddings to convert text into vectors, FAISS for efficient similarity search, and a docstore to manage the documents for retrieval based on query similarity.
